Instacart Grocery Basket Analysis (Achievement 4 â€“ Python Project)
Project Overview

This repository contains my Achievement 4 data immersion project for CareerFoundry, focused on analyzing online grocery shopping behavior for Instacart. The goal of this project was to explore patterns in customer orders and develop actionable insights for marketing and customer segmentation.

Using Python and Jupyter Notebooks, I cleaned, merged, and analyzed multiple datasets with over 30 million rows. I used pandas, NumPy, matplotlib, and seaborn to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), create customer segments, and visualize patterns in shopping frequency, spending behavior, and product preferences.
Key Deliverables

    Created new variables such as customer loyalty, spending habits, and family status

    Performed grouping and aggregation to uncover trends in ordering behavior

    Generated four key visualizations to support stakeholder decision-making
